This [UX Metrics Playbook](https://ux-metrics.com/) is a guide that provides a framework for selecting, measuring, and analyzing UX metrics to inform decision-making across the product lifecycle. It helps teams understand what metrics to use, how to measure them, and how to use them to drive actions that improve the user experience. 

The playbook includes a range of metrics and provides guidance on which ones to focus on depending on the stage of the product lifecycle, and the goals of the product team. The playbook is a valuable resource for product managers, UX researchers, and designers who want to improve the user experience and drive business outcomes.

The current UX Metrics Playbook is built with:
- CSS Tricks
- FontAwesome
- Google Analytics
- Sass
